       "summary":"Artificial neural networks, evolutionary computation and multi-agent systems that show emergent behavior fascinate me in their ability to come up with surprisingly creative solutions to a broad range of problems. Even when these algorithms fail, they tend to fail in a natural way, making mistakes that can seem eerily human. Apart from having a wide range of practical applications, these models may provide us with insights into human and animal intelligence. I enjoy exploring generative models in an artistic context and integrating multidisciplinary ideas drawing from a variety of fields  such as game theory, computer science, foresight research, generative art, music, signal processing, and computer vision.",
